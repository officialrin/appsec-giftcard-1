On NYU Classes, submit a link to your GitHub repository. The repository

Please see your course page to see who your grader is. Please only add your
grader the day you turn your assignment in.

  * At least one signed commit
  * A directory named `tests` that contains `crash1.gft`, `crash2.gft`,
    `hang.gft`.
  * A markdown writeup called `writeup.md` with a heading named `bugs`
  * An updated GitHub Actions Workflow file that runs your tests
  * A commit with the fixed version of the code (if you like, this

  * A directory named `fuzz` that contains `cov1.gft`, `cov2.gft`,
    `fuzzer1.gft`, `fuzzer2.gft`.
